// Create an algorithm that will loop from 1 to 30
// If a number is divisible by 3 it will print "Fizz"
// if a number is divisible by 5 it will print "Buzz"
// If a number if divisible by 3 AND 5 it will print "FizzBuzz"
// If it is not divisible by either the number will print out

//The expected output will be 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz .... etc
